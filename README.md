# Array. Array cleaning. Removing duplicates from the array.

Use a `for...of` loop to loop through all elements of the array, the `toLowerCase()` method to convert each element to lower case. Elements that have not yet been encountered are added to the resulting array. Thus, the function `removeDuplicates(arr)` removes duplicates from an array, regardless of case.
